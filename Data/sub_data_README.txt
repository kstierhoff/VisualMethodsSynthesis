Kevin,
Shared with you on Google Drive an Access file containing nav and ctd 
data for our Gear Comparison project. Data are for entire dives as per 
your request (that's what my notes say, let me know if you need 
different). Data with 0s in the transect and segment fields were 
collected outside of a transect (i.e. before, in between, or after 
transects). Data with >0 in the transect and segment fields were 
collected during transects.

Let me know if you have questions or need further assistance.

Di
