  abstract      = {Underwater sounds generated by Thunnus albacares and Thunnus thynnus
	were recorded and studied to explore the possibility of passive-acoustical
	detection. Possible tuna sounds were recorded at the Monterey Bay
	Aquarium, Monterey, California, and Maricultura del Norte in Ensensada,
	Baja California, Mexico. At both locations, the most prevalent sounds
	seemingly associated with tuna were low-frequency pulses varying
	from 20 to 130 Hz, lasting about 0.1 s, and usually single and apparently
	unanswered. A behavior similar to coughing was coincident with these
	sounds: the animal's mouth opened wide with its jaw bones extended
	and its abdomen expanded, then contracted abruptly. On one occasion
	in Mexico, this behavior and associated signal were simultaneously
	recorded. Because these measurements were made in noisy environments,
	this study should be repeated under more controlled conditions before
	tuna vocalizations can be claimed with certainty. Nevertheless, the
	center frequencies of these sounds appear to vary with respect to
	the resonant frequencies of the tuna's swim bladder, suggesting a
	passive-acoustical proxy for measuring the size of tuna. Matched
	filter and phase-difference techniques were explored as means for
	automating the detection and bearing-estimation processes. (C) 2003

  abstract      = {In January and February 2000, four ships conducted an extensive hydrographic
	survey of the Scotia Sea as part of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey. There
	were 169 CTD stations to at least 1000 m depth, making this the largest
	synoptic dataset since 1981. A hydrographic section at Drake Passage
	was used to define water masses and ocean fronts. In 2000, the Subantarctic
	Front and the Polar Front were unusually close, and the entire survey
	occurred to the south of the Polar Front. The survey area was bisected
	by the Subantarctic Circumpolar Current Front and the Southern Boundary
	of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In Drake Passage, these fronts
	were widely spaced. A further two hydrographic sections to the cast
	of Drake Passage show that the relative location of these fronts
	changes east of Drake Passage. Horizontal maps across the survey
	area show that close to Drake Passage, properties are aligned in
	a southwest to northeast direction. At approximately 35degreesW,
	properties become orientated in a north-south direction. A map of
	geopotential anomaly shows the flow field across the survey area
	and allows identification of oceanic fronts. In months previous to
	the survey, the giant icebergs A22B and B10A crossed the Scotia Sea
	and closely followed the geopotential field from the CCAMLR 2000
	dataset. The SACCF is not the only important front for transporting
	biological matter from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia;
	an interaction between the SBACC and the SACCF is also likely to
	be important. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	superba, in areas around South Georgia (SG) and Elephant Island (EI)
	were compared for seven austral summers between 1981 and 1997. Estimated
	densities of krill at SG were most often lower than at EI, although
	this may simply have been a function of differences in the survey
	and data-analysis techniques used at each site. More interestingly,
	the magnitudes of density and between-year gradients of density at
	each site were mirrored by those at the other location; for example
	1991 and 1994 were years of very low krill density at both SG and
	EI. There was no apparent lag in changes in density between sites,
	and ranked between-year gradients in density at both locations were
	closely correlated. These pronounced similarities suggest that densities
	of krill at both locations are linked directly, and may be impacted
	by the same gross physical and biological factors (e.g. recruitment,
	dispersal and environmental variability) acting over the same temporal
	and spatial scales. The observed concordance also implies that the
	pelagic ecosystems at these widely separated sites (similar or equal
	to 1500 km distant at opposite sides of the Scotia Sea) are not operating
	in isolation. Fluctuations in krill density were investigated with
	reference to cyclical variations in sea ice extent, and in air and
	sea-surface temperature. The resulting model suggests that the 1999/2000
	austral summer will be one of low krill density.},

	was treated analogously to motion along-track of a research vessel
	through a nominally stationary body of water during a conventional

	where krill are generally passive drifters on currents and where
	temporal fluctuations in abundance have significant consequences
	for krill-dependent predators. Moorings were positioned on routine
	research vessel survey transects, and validity of the mooring method
	was assessed by comparison of mooring and vessel observations. Krill
	density estimates from the moorings were not statistically different
	from vessel estimates in adjacent time periods. A time series of
	krill density from a mooring revealed step-changes that were not
	seen during short-term vessel surveys. Moorings deliver data over

	method only considered relative transducer positions and assumed
	that the beam axes of the transducers were parallel. The method was
	improved by first, optimizing the accuracy and precision of the range
	and angular measurements of the individual frequency detections;
	and second, precisely determining acoustically the relative positions
	and angular orientations of the transducers, thus completely describing
	the reference-system transformation(s). Algorithms are presented
	for accurately and precisely estimating the transformation parameters,
	and efficiently rejecting multiple targets while retaining measurements
	of most single targets. These improvements are demonstrated through
	simulations, controlled test-tank experiments, and shipboard measurements
	using 38- and 120-kHz split-beam transducers. The results indicate
	that the improved multiple-frequency TS method can reject more than
	97% of multiple targets, while allowing 99% of the resolvable single
	targets to be measured. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration

	Both parameters are obtained from the correlations of the reverberated-scattered
	transient pressure fields for different scatterers positions. This
	technique is based on a diffusive field theory [de Rosny et al.,
	Phys. Rev. Lett., 90, 094302 (2003)]. Here, a more systematic approach

	extension is proposed using the fourth-order moment of the field,
	or the variance of the correlation estimator. Contrary to the correlations
	(second-order moment) that allow the measurement of the scattering
	cross section, its variance (fourth-order moment) is shown to be
	mainly sensitive to the scatterer displacement. The robustness of
	DRAWS is discussed using different configurations: a computer simulation
	of a moving scatterer in a two-dimensional cavity. Experiments were
	also carried out with a 23-mm-diameter copper sphere moved by stepping

	six distinct types of data that can be used in various combinations
	to understand their foraging behavior and ecology. We describe methods
	that combine concurrent dive recorder deployment, oceanographic sampling,
	and hydroacoustic surveys to generate hypotheses about interactions
	between the physical environment and the distribution, abundance,
	and behavior of pelagic predators and their prey. Our approach is
	to (1) map the distribution of whales in relation to the distribution
	of their prey and the physical features of the study area (bottom
	topography, temperature, and salinity); and (2) measure the foraging
	behavior and diet of instrumented whales in the context of the fine-scale
	distribution and composition of their prey and the physical environment.
	We use this approach to demonstrate a relationship between blue whale
	distribution, sea surface temperature, and concentrations of their
	euphausiid prey at different spatial scales offshore of the Channel
	Islands, California. Blue whale horizontal spatial distribution was
	correlated with regions of high acoustic backscatter. Blue whale
	dive depths closely tracked the depth distribution of krill. Net
	sampling and whale diet revealed that whales fed exclusively upon
	dense schools of Euphausia pacifica (between 100 and 200 m) and Thysanoessa
	spinifera (from the surface to 100 m). Whales concentrated foraging
	efforts upon those dense euphausiid schools that form downstream
	from an upwelling center in close proximity to regions of steep topographic
	relief We propose that (1) the distribution of Balaenoptera whales
	in the coastal California Current region is defined by their attraction
	to areas of predictably high prey density; (2) the preferred prey
	of these whales are several species of euphausiids (E. pacifica,
	T. spinifera, and N. simplex) that are abundant in the California
	Current region; (3) blue whales concentrate their foraging efforts
	on dense aggregations of euphausiids found at discrete depths in
	the water column; (4) these localized areas of high euphausiid densities
	are predictable and sustained by enhanced levels of primary productivity
	in regions which are located downstream from coastal upwelling centers
	(indicated by sea surface temperature); (5) topographic breaks in
	the continental shelf located downstream from these upwelling centers
	work in concert with euphausiid behavior to collect and maintain
	large concentrations of euphausiids swarms, and (6) despite seasonal
	and inter-annual variability, these processes are sufficiently consistent
	that the distribution of Balaenoptera whales can be predicted. (C)

	new, quiet, NOAA FSVs. The ME70 has configurable beams and transmits

	(bathymetric mode, BM). Furthermore, with custom algorithms and software,
	bathymetric data can be obtained from the ME70 operating in FM, and

	vs. lateral-incidence angles, backscatter did vary with roll angle.
	In the hypothetical case of fish avoiding a vessel, the backscatter
	decreases strongly the outer beams. The results of the model were

  abstract      = {Antarctic krill, Eaphausia superba, comprises the foundation of the
	foodweb in the Southern Ocean and is the target of a large fishery.
	Recently, the total abundance of krill in the Scotia Sea was estimated
	from an international echosounder and net survey (CCAMLR 2000) to
	be 44.3 million metric tonnes (Mt; CV 11.4%) (Hewitt et al., 2002).
	The new biomass estimate prompted the Antarctic Treaty's Commission
	for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)
	to revise the precautionary catch level for krill in the area from
	1.5 to 4 Mt (SC-CAMLR, 2000). These survey results are based on the
	total echo energy attributed to krill, scaled by the Greene et al.
	(1991) model of krill acoustical reflectivity or target strength
	(TS). Presented here is a re-analysis of the CCAMLR 2000 data incorporating
	recent improvements in the characterization of krill TS. The results
	indicate that the estimated krill biomass in the Scotia Sea may be
	as high as 192.4 Mt (CV = 11.7%), or as low as 109.4 Mt (CV = 10.4%),
	depending solely on the expected distribution of krill orientations.
	The new Stochastic, Distorted-Wave, Born-Approximation (SDWBA) TS
	model solved with an empirically estimated distribution of in situ
	orientations leads to a krill-biomass estimate that is nearly 2.5
	times the previous estimate. In consequence, revisions may be warranted
	of the standard krill TS model, the CCAMLR 2000 biomass estimate,
	and the associated precautionary catch level for krill in the Scotia
	Sea. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International

  abstract      = {Total-scattering cross-sections (sigma(t)) of Antarctic krill (Euphausia
	superba) were measured over a broad bandwidth (36-202 kHz) using
	a new technique based on acoustical reverberation in a cavity. From
	18 February to 9 March 2002, mean total target strengths (TTS 10
	log(sigma(t)/4pi)), were measured from groups of 57-1169 krill (average
	standard length 31.6 turn; standard deviation = 6.6 mm) at the Cape
	Shirreff field station, Livingston Island, Antarctica, and aboard
	RV "Yuzhmorgeologiya". Chirp pulses were transmitted sequentially
	by an omni-directional emitter into one of three glass carboys containing
	groups of krill swimming in 9.3, 19.3, or 45.9 liters of seawater
	(0.6degreesC less than or equal totemperatureless than or equal to
	4.0degreesC). Between each pulse the krill moved within the fixed-boundary
	tank and the modulated reverberations were sensed bi-statically with
	three omni-directional receivers. At each center frequency (f(c))
	the coherent energy in 200-pulse ensembles identified sound scattered
	by the tank. The incoherent energy described total sound scattering
	from the krill, Thus, the TTS at each f(c) was extracted from a correlation
	analysis of energy reverberated in the tank. Measurement bias was
	determined to be +/-0.4 dB from an experiment using metal sphere
	reference targets, and the precision was estimated as +/-0.8 dB from
	the variability in the krill TTS (f(c)) measurements. The empirical
	estimates of mean sigma(t) corroborated a krill-scattering model
	based on the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA), enhanced by
	the authors to account for the stochastic nature of sound scattering
	(SDWBA), integrated over all scattering angles and averaged over
	all incident angles (SDWBA(TTS)). The SDWBA, solved for target strength
	of Antarctic krill, may be the best predictor of backscatter for
	this important species and may also provide backscattering spectra
	for improving their acoustic identification. These advances may help
	to reduce uncertainty in krill-biomass estimation using multi-frequency
	echosounder data and echo-integration methods. Published by Elsevier

	of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, versus incidence angle (theta)
	(Deep Sea Res. 1145(7) (1998) 1273). Based on the distorted-wave
	Born approximation (DWBA), the model depends on the coherent summation
	of scattering from elements of a discretized-bent cylinder. It was
	empirically validated at 120 kHz near-broadside incidence (theta
	approximate to 90degrees), but large discrepancies were observed
	at other angles away from the main lobe. As the side-lobe measurements
	were both higher than the model predictions and above the noise floor,
	the authors noted that the differences were not entirely due to noise.
	In this study, the accuracy of the DWBA model is further explored.
	Results indicate that phase variability in the scatter from elements
	of a discretized-bent cylinder (krill model) causes a dramatic flattening
	in the side-lobe regions of TS(theta), while negligibly affecting
	the main scattering lobe. These results are consistent with the krill
	TS measurements reported by McGehee et al. Thus, by accounting for
	phase variability in the solution of the DWBA model, a more accurate
	and thus practical tool is developed for predicting krill TS. (C)

	The data were compared to both empirical and theoretical models of
	reduced target strength (TS normalized by the square of the animal

	radius). The theoretical models chosen for this comparison were two
	versions of a high-pass bent-cylinder model (Stanton, 1989b) that
	indicate TS is dependent on animal volume, and the ray bent-cylinder
	model (Stanton, 1993a) which implies TS is dependent on the cross-sectional
	area. The dependence of acoustic backscattering on animal volume
	or area was tested by fitting regression lines for TS versus the
	logs of ka, length (L), wet weight (WW), and dry weight (DW). Contrary
	to an empirical model derived from similar experiments (Wiebe et
	al., 1990), and to the high-pass models, the regressions indicated
	that TS is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the animal.
	However, because scattering from individual zooplankton is highly
	nonlinear, especially in the geometric scattering region (ka>1),
	linear regressions of TS versus the log of ka, L, WW, or DW can be
	misleading. Furthermore, neither Wiebe er al. (1990) nor this experiment

  abstract      = {During the last century, the population of Pacific sardine (Sardinops
	sagax) in the California Current Ecosystem has exhibited large fluctuations
	in abundance and migration behavior. From approximately 1900 to 1940,
	the abundance of sardine reached 3.6 million metric tons and the
	"northern stock" migrated from offshore of California in the spring
	to the coastal areas near Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver Island
	in the summer. In the 1940s, the sardine stock collapsed and the
	few remaining sardine schools concentrated in the coastal region
	off southern California, year-round, for the next 50 years. The stock
	gradually recovered in the late 1980s and resumed its seasonal migration
	between regions off southern California and Canada. Recently, a model
	was developed which predicts the potential habitat for the northern
	stock of Pacific sardine and its seasonal dynamics. The habitat predictions
	were successfully validated using data from sardine surveys using
	the daily egg production method; scientific trawl surveys off the
	Columbia River mouth; and commercial sardine landings off Oregon,
	Washington, and Vancouver Island. Here, the predictions of the potential
	habitat and seasonal migration of the northern stock of sardine are
	validated using data from "acoustic-trawl" surveys of the entire
	west coast of the United States during the spring and summer of 2008.
	The estimates of sardine biomass and lengths from the two surveys
	are not significantly different between spring and summer, indicating
	that they are representative of the entire stock. The results also
	confirm that the model of potential sardine habitat can be used to
	optimally apply survey effort and thus minimize random and systematic
	sampling error in the biomass estimates. Furthermore, the acoustic-trawl
	survey data are useful to estimate concurrently the distributions
	and abundances of other pelagic fishes.},

	(SL) values greater than similar to 17 cm). Due to these catchability
	and length-selectivity assumptions, the ATM-and assessment-estimated

	estimates include large abundances ofsmall sardine (SL values less
	than similar to 15 cm) that are not represented in either theATM-survey
	results or the fishery landings, and generally did not recruit to
	themigrating northern stock sampled by the ATM surveys. We considered
	four explanations for this disparity: (i) the ATMlength-selectivity

	a smaller portion of the stock than indicated by the assessments;
	(iii) during years of lowrecruitment success, those size classesmay
	be virtually completely fished by the Ensenada and San Pedro fisheries;

	the two surveys, a low-pressure system (963 mbar) passed through
	the area providing the opportunity to measure ecosystem parameters
	before and after a near gale. A ship-based multiple-frequency acoustic-backscatter
	survey was used to assess the distribution and relative abundance
	of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Net tows, hydrographic profiles,
	and meteorological data were collected to measure biological and
	physical processes that might affect the krill population. During
	the survey, the distribution and behavior of several krill predators
	[chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica), cape petrels (Daption
	capense), and Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)] were measured
	from the vessel by visual observations. The survey encompassed an
	area of roughly 2,500 km(2), containing two submarine canyons with
	one to the west and one to the east of Cape Shirreff, which had different
	abundances of krill and predators. Several aspects of the nearshore
	ecosystem changed after the near gale including: hydrography of the
	upper 100 m of the water column, phytoplankton biomass, the abundance
	and distribution of krill, and the distribution of some krill predators.
	Differences in these parameters were also measured between the two
	canyons. These changes in the physical and biological environment
	during the survey period are quantified and show that the ecosystem
	exhibited significant changes over relatively short spatial (tens
	of kilometers) and time (tens of hours) scales.},

	nature of interactions between predators and prey at the spatial
	and temporal scales relevant to an individual predator's search behavior.
	Here, we present a new method for examining such interactions using
	the results from an acoustic survey of krill availability to foraging
	penguins. Analyses of fine-scale krill distributions within a 1852
	x 1852 x 50 m volume of ocean revealed substantial prey patchiness
	in all dimensions. Our survey detected the presence of at least 6
	krill aggregations in the survey area. The surface distribution of
	penguins was associated with the edges of these aggregations and
	was nonrandomly associated with krill densities above 0.1 krill m(-3)
	in the 30 to 40 m depth layer. The latter association was masked
	when krill abundance was integrated over the entire water column.
	Given that mean daytime dive depths for chinstrap penguins fall between
	30 and 40 m, our data suggest penguins may fail to detect or choose
	to pass by shallow, denser prey aggregations and successfully forage
	on deeper, more homogeneously distributed krill offering higher encounter
	probabilities per unit volume searched. These findings reveal biologically
	important features of prey patchiness that cannot be addressed within
	the limitations of a primarily 2-dimensional analysis of predator-prey
	distributions. We emphasize that if we hope to gain a predictive
	understanding of the foraging behavior of diving predators, then
	we must consider fine-scale, 3-dimensional patterns of prey patchiness
	when assessing the availability of prey to diving predators.},

An experimental frame was designed to support a transducer, fish cage, standard calibration target, and two video cameras. Pacific herring were measured at a variety of depths while they swam freely in an acoustically transparent cylinder that was secured 3 m below the transducer. Pacific sand lance were measured while tethered at a 4-m depth. We found that both depth and season affected the target strength of Pacific herring. The TS of individual Pacific herring declined as they were lowered in the water column. The decline was in accord with that expected from the effects of Boyle's Law on the swim bladder volume. This impact of depth may explain the apparent discrepancy in published target strength algorithms for Atlantic herring C. harengus and Pacific herring. The depth distribution of Atlantic herring is typically deeper. The results suggest that the depth of measurement needs to be considered in both target strength measurements and acoustic surveys of herring. We also found higher target strengths of Pacific herring during spring than in fall. Larger swim bladder volumes may be associated with spent fish or reduced lipid content during spring. The measurements on the juvenile Pacific sand lance, which lack swim bladders, yielded a much lower target strength than Pacific herring of equivalent size. However, the observed values were appreciably higher than the TS algorithm published for sand lance Ammodytes spp. in the Atlantic Ocean. },
